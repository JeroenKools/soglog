**Soglog** keeps track of your active window, telling you how much time you've spent on your work, study or research, and how much was wasted surfing the internet or playing games. You probably know what I'm talking about.

The name is derived from the Dutch acronym _SOG_, for _Studie-ontwijkend gedrag_, which translates to "Study avoidant behavior". It can also be used as a verb. "I sogged so hard today!". In fact it's pretty close to the English word "procrastination". So, this programs helps to log your sog. Obvious limitation: it only detects which window is open, it doesn't know whether you're actually working, or dozing off, staring into the distance, annoying the people around you, etc.
